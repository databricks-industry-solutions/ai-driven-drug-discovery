## Overview  

<br> 

The following diagram illustrates the flow of processes involved and the [Databricks Intelligent Platform](https://www.databricks.com/resources/demos/tours/horizontal/introducing-databricks-intelligence-platform) features utilized (in red).

The [processed data written to Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/data-governance/unity-catalog) and [served external foundational model endpoint](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/external-models.html) will be used to create the associated ["_multi-page_" AI/BI Genie](dashboards/README.md) [Dashboard](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dashboards/); 

<!-- > _**`to provide an example of how GenAI can be leveraged to discover more about protein properties and whether there are candidate proteins that are under-researched in areas that show promise for potential drug discovery.`**_ -->

**NB:** we provide an exported dashboard template in the `/dashboards` folder

When a AIBI dashboard is [Genie Space](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dashboards/genie-spaces) enabled during publication, users can _"[Ask Genie](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/ai-driven-drug-discovery/blob/mmt_devs/assets/imgs/Dashboard_GenieSpace_enabled.png)"_ and [talk to your data](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/ai-driven-drug-discovery/blob/mmt_devs/assets/imgs/AIBI_autogenerated_GenieSpace.png) about the datasets and [additional example questions](./dashboards/GenieSpace_AdditionalExampleQs_GeneratedQueries) are provided as guidance.

#### Databricks Features

| Area | Feature | Role in this solution | Why it matters |
|------|---------|-----------------------|----------------|
| **Data & Governance** | **[Lakehouse / Delta](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/index.html)** | Stores FASTA raw files and derived protein tables (`enriched_protein`, semantic and research-enriched tables). | Central, scalable store for all protein data and features. |
| **Data & Governance** | **[Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html)** | Governs access to tables and SQL functions (`scientific2simple`, `get_protein_research_info`). | Secure, governed foundation shared by DLT, AI/BI dashboards, and Genie. |
| **Data Engineering** | **[Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/index.html)** / ("DLT") | Pipeline that ingests and preprocesses FASTA into structured protein tables with quality checks. | Reliable, declarative ETL so downstream AI/BI always sees clean, current data. |
| **Computation** | **[pandas UDFs](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/udf/pandas)** | Applies vectorized protein language model inference during the Protein Classification step. | Scales Python/ML inference across large protein datasets. |
| **SQL & AIBI** | **[Databricks SQL](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/index.html)** | Runs aggregations and joins for distributions, counts, and high-confidence protein subsets. | Single query layer for both classic analytics and AI-enriched columns. |
| **SQL & AIBI** | **[AI/BI Dashboards](https://docs.databricks.com/en/ai-bi/index.html)** | Presents tiles for summary stats, distributions, organism comparisons, and detailed protein tables. | Visual exploration of protein data for non-coders. |
| **SQL & AIBI** | **Dashboard parameters & visuals** | Filters (`Organism_SimpleTerm`, `score thresholds`, `ProteinType`) and charts/tables bound to SQL. | Interactive “what-if” exploration within the dashboard. |
| **AI Integration** | **[`ai_query()`](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/functions/ai_query)** / **[AI functions](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/large-language-models/ai-functions)** | SQL entry point to LLMs, used inside `scientific2simple` and `get_protein_research_info`. | Directly augments tables with AI-generated fields from within SQL. |
| **AI Integration** | **[Databricks hosted foundational LLMs: FMAPI](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models)** (e.g., Llama, Claude, OpenAI, etc.)| Power `scientific2simple()` to convert scientific organism/protein text into layman terms. | Creates the semantic layer (`Organism_SimpleTerm`, `SimpleTerms`). |
| **AI Integration** | **[External models](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/external-models.html)** (e.g., AzureOpenaI_GPT4o)| Power `get_protein_research_info()` to attach recent/under‑researched context. | Turns rows into actionable research leads. |
| **AI Integration** | **[UC Functions](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-sql-function)** (SQL & Python) | Registers `scientific2simple()` and `get_protein_research_info()` as reusable SQL functions. | Standardizes and reuses AI logic across queries, dashboards, and Genie. |
| **Exploration UX** | **EDA & ad-hoc queries** | Parameterized tiles and queries for distributions, diversity, and high‑confidence subsets. | Guided and custom exploration on the same governed data. |
| **Exploration UX** | **Precomputed enrichment** | Stores AI-enriched research info in UC tables consumed by the dashboard. | Fast interaction without repeated external model calls. |
| **Conversational Analytics** | **[Genie Space](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/index.html)** | Natural-language interface over the same UC tables and functions. | Lets users explore proteins and insights via chat instead of SQL. |
| **Operationalization** | **AI semantic layer** | `Organism_SimpleTerm` and `SimpleTerms` reused by dashboards and Genie. | Bridges scientific jargon and business-friendly search/filter terms. |

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your Databricks Workspace.    

You will find the set of notebooks referenced above within the `/notebooks` folder, the dashboards json files within `/dashboards`.    
Dashboard Unity Catalog-tables will need to be re-referenced after they are being generated via the notebooks. 

Please refer to `README.md` within [`./notebooks`](notebook/README.md) section for more details about each notebook and how to run them and refer to the `README.md` within [`./dashboards`](dashboards/README.md) for guidance on dashboard configurations.
